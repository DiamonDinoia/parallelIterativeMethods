This repo implements different variations of the Jacobi algorithm. 

In particular the performance of block and async methods are tested on sparse and dense matrices using 
the standard implementation as baseline.

The test are performend by computing the solution of random generated matrices and the equilibrium distribution of a transitions matrices.
